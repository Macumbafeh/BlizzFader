# BlizzFader

I was a Xperl user back in the day, but i stopped using it, and i was missing a feature : The Fade out when out of range.

So this addon Fade out the Default target and Party Frames based on spells you choose.

I added also a highlight feature :
- Red Color is an indicator when you are in Melee range for melee abilities (5 Yards)
- Yellow Color is an indicator when you are in Deadzone range (5-8 Yards)

You can also change those color for what you want.


There is a GUI in interface - Option, or you can access it with "/bf" or "/blizzfader" command.
- To change the Alpha of the Fade out feature
- To disable / Enable Red melee range and Yellow Deadzone range
- Change the color of Red melee range and Yellow Deadzone range
- Disable the Fade out for Enemies Target
- Choose a Spell for the range of the fade out
- Disable the Fade out for Friendly Target / Party
- A button to Reload the UI (not necessary but if you have a bug with the addon it can help)
